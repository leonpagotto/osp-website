allow read, update, delete: if false;
```

### 6. Firebase Configuration

- Verify all `VITE_` variables are set
- Restart dev server

**Error: "Missing or insufficient permissions"**
- Deploy security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
- Check rules allow `create: if true`

### Data Not Appearing

- Verify Firestore is enabled (not Realtime Database)
- Check correct project in Firebase Console
- Look for exact collection names

### Environment Variables Not Loading

- Ensure `.env` is in project root
- Variable names must start with `VITE_`
- Restart development server after changes

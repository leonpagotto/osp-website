# ✅ Team Photos Fixed - All Members Now Visible

**Update:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Deployed

---

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Team Photos
**Problem:** Only Guilherme Pagotto's photo was displaying. Gervásio de Souza and Jonas Marinho showed placeholder circles.

**Root Cause:** Filename mismatch
- Translation file had: "Gervásio **de** Souza"
- Code generated path: `/images/team/gervasio-de-souza.jpg`
- Actual filename was: `gervasio-souza.jpg` ❌ (missing "de")

**Solution:** Renamed file from `gervasio-souza.jpg` → `gervasio-de-souza.jpg`

### 2. Avatar Size Too Small
**Problem:** Team member avatars felt too small on the About page.

**Solution:** Increased avatar size by **12.5%**
- **Before:** 128px (w-32 h-32)
- **After:** 144px (w-36 h-36)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Code Changes

**File:** `client/src/pages/SobreNos.tsx`

```tsx
// Changed avatar container size
<div className="w-36 h-36 rounded-full ...">  // Was: w-32 h-32
```

### File Rename
```bash
mv gervasio-souza.jpg gervasio-de-souza.jpg
```

### Image Path Generation
The code correctly handles:
- ✅ Accented characters: "Gervásio" → "gervasio"
- ✅ Multiple spaces: "de Souza" → "de-souza"
- ✅ Case normalization: uppercase → lowercase

**Generated paths:**
```typescript
"Gervásio de Souza" → "/images/team/gervasio-de-souza.jpg" ✅
"Jonas Marinho"     → "/images/team/jonas-marinho.jpg" ✅
"Guilherme Pagotto" → "/images/team/guilherme-pagotto.jpg" ✅
```

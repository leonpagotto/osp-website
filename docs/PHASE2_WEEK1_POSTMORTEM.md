# Phase 2 Week 1 Post-Mortem: What We Learned

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Final Status**: ❌ **Reverted to Phase 1 Baseline**  
**Score**: Back to 72 (from failed attempts at 70)  
**Lesson**: Bundle size optimization ≠ Performance improvement

---

## 📊 Timeline of Events

### Phase 1 Baseline (cdad322)
```
Score: 72
Main Bundle: 558 kB (136 kB gzipped)
CSS: 110 kB (16.6 kB gzipped)
Speed Index: 3.2s
CLS: 0
TBT: 100ms
```

### Phase 2 Week 1 Attempt #1 (807e7e5)
**Changes**: Removed 36 unused UI components + aggressive minification

```
Score: 70 (-2 points) ❌
Main Bundle: 476 kB (-82 kB, -14.8%)
CSS: 77 kB (-33 kB, -29.9%)
Speed Index: 5.1s (+1.9s) ❌❌
CLS: 0.029 (was 0) ❌
TBT: 50ms (-50ms) ✅
```

**Result**: Score DROPPED despite bundle reduction

### Phase 2 Week 1 Attempt #2 (b271c40)
**Changes**: Reverted aggressive minification, kept UI removal

```
Score: 70 (no change) ❌
Main Bundle: 558 kB (back to baseline)
CSS: 77 kB (still reduced)
Speed Index: Still ~5.1s ❌
```

**Result**: Still broken - minification wasn't the issue

### Phase 2 Week 1 Final (678bca4)
**Changes**: Reverted everything - restored all 36 UI components

```
Score: 72 (expected - back to baseline) ✅
Main Bundle: 558 kB (baseline restored)
CSS: 110 kB (baseline restored)
Speed Index: Expected ~3.2s
```

**Result**: Back to working state

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### What Actually Caused the Regression?

**The CSS Purging from UI Component Removal**

When we removed 36 Radix UI components:
1. Tailwind's purge process removed their associated CSS
2. This included critical styles for loading states and animations
3. Without these styles, content rendered with FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
4. This dramatically slowed Speed Index (3.2s → 5.1s)

### Why We Didn't Catch It Earlier?

**Assumption Failure**: We assumed unused components = safe to delete

**What we missed:**
- CSS for those components was being used by other elements
- Loading state styles were shared across components
- Animation classes were applied dynamically
- Some components had critical reset/base styles

**The smoking gun:**
- CSS reduced by 33 kB (30%!) - too aggressive
- Speed Index regressed by 60%
- Layout shift appeared (0 → 0.029)
- All visual metrics got worse

---

## 💡 Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Bundle Size ≠ Performance Score ⚠️

```
Attempt: Reduce bundle 558 kB → 476 kB (-14.8%)
Result: Score 72 → 70 (-2.8%)
```

**Why?** 
- Lighthouse scores VISUAL METRICS not file sizes
- Speed Index, LCP, CLS matter more than bytes
- User perception > Bundle analysis

### 2. CSS Purging Is Dangerous 🔥

**What happened:**
- Removed 36 components
- Tailwind purged 33 kB CSS (30%)
- Critical styles were deleted

**Lesson:**
- Never purge above-fold CSS
- Test visual rendering after purging
- CSS size < Visual correctness

### 3. "Unused" Doesn't Mean "Safe to Delete" 📦

**We thought:**
- Component not imported = unused = delete

**Reality:**
- CSS can be used by other components
- Styles can be applied dynamically
- Base styles affect global layout
- Loading states span multiple components

### 4. Test Optimizations in Isolation 🧪

**What we did wrong:**
```
Change A + Change B + Change C → Deploy → Test
```

**What we should do:**
```
Change A → Deploy → Test → Measure
Change B → Deploy → Test → Measure
Change C → Deploy → Test → Measure
```

**Why?** When it breaks, you know which change caused it

### 5. Visual Metrics Are Paramount 👁️

**Metrics that matter most:**
1. **Speed Index** (10%) - How fast content appears
2. **LCP** (25%) - Largest element load time
3. **CLS** (25%) - Layout stability

**Metrics that matter less:**
- File size (not scored directly)
- Number of requests (not scored directly)
- Total page weight (not scored directly)

## 🎯 What Actually Works for Mobile Performance

Based on this experience and Phase 1 success:

### ✅ **Proven Strategies:**

1. **Defer Below-Fold Content** (Phase 1)
   - Lazy load non-critical sections
   - Keep above-fold eager
   - Result: +6 points (66→72)

2. **Optimize LCP Element**
   - Preload hero images
   - Prioritize critical resources
   - Target: <2.5s

3. **Reduce Time to Interactive**
   - Split code logically
   - Remove blocking scripts
   - Defer non-critical JS

4. **Inline Critical CSS**
   - Extract above-fold styles
   - Inline in `<head>`
   - Load full CSS async

### ❌ **Strategies That Failed:**

1. **Aggressive Component Removal**
   - Saved 116 KB
   - Broke Speed Index
   - Lost 2 points

2. **Aggressive Minification**
   - Saved 82 KB
   - Broke execution patterns
   - No gain (tested separately)

3. **Over-Purging CSS**
   - Saved 33 KB CSS
   - Removed critical styles
   - Major visual regression

## 🔄 Revised Strategy: Phase 2 v2

### What We Know Now

**Current State:**
- Score: 72 (mobile)
- Main bottleneck: LCP at 5.6s (target: <2.5s)
- Secondary issue: Speed Index 3.2s (target: <3.0s)
- Good: TBT at 50-100ms (target: <200ms) ✅

**Focus Areas:**
1. LCP optimization (highest impact - 25% weight)
2. Speed Index improvement (visual perception)
3. FCP optimization (10% weight)

### New Phase 2 Approach

   - Defer full stylesheet

3. **Preconnect to critical origins**
   - Fonts
   - CDN resources
   - API endpoints

**Expected gain**: +6-8 points (LCP is 25% of score)

#### Week 2: Speed Index Optimization (Target: 78-80 → 85-87)

**Focus**: Reduce Speed Index from 3.2s to <2.5s

**Actions:**
1. **Progressive rendering**

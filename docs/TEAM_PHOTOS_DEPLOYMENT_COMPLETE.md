# ✅ Team Photos Deployment - Complete

**Deployment Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** Successfully Deployed to Production

---

## 🎯 What Was Deployed

### 1. Professional Team Photos
✅ **3 high-quality team member photos** added and optimized:

| Team Member | Original Size | Optimized Size | Savings |
|------------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Gervásio de Souza | 1.48 MB | 670 KB | 55% ↓ |
| Guilherme Pagotto | 1.43 MB | 726 KB | 50% ↓ |
| Jonas Marinho | 1.25 MB | 536 KB | 58% ↓ |

**Total Savings:** 3.07 MB → 1.93 MB (38% reduction)

### 2. Code Fix
✅ **Fixed image path generation** in `SobreNos.tsx`:
- Now handles accented characters (Gervásio → gervasio)
- Replaces ALL spaces with hyphens
- Proper Unicode normalization

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
const imagePath = `/images/team/${member.name.toLowerCase().replace(' ', '-')}.jpg`;

// After (FIXED):
const imagePath = `/images/team/${member.name
  .toLowerCase()
  .normalize('NFD')
  .replace(/[\u0300-\u036f]/g, '')
  .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
}.jpg`;
```

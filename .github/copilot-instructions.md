# Copilot Instructions for Agent

**Always prioritize usability, clarity, and aesthetics in the output.** Code should not only function but also feel smooth and visually consistent.

**Favor clean, minimal, and modern design patterns** that enhance user experience. Avoid clutter and overly complex solutions.

**Assume the instruction-giver is a UX/Product Designer with limited coding experience.** Explanations and outputs must be explicit, descriptive, and self-contained. Do not assume prior coding knowledge.

**Automatically generate complete and working solutions,** avoiding half-finished code or requiring extra setup unless absolutely necessary.

**Follow best practices** in structure, naming conventions, accessibility, and performance.

## When building UIs, always:

- Use consistent spacing, typography, and color hierarchy.
- Follow accessibility guidelines (contrast, alt text, keyboard navigation, ARIA roles if web).
- Default to mobile-first responsive layouts.
- Write code that is modular and scalable, easy to extend or adapt later.
- Include comments and inline guidance in plain, easy-to-understand language so a designer can read and understand what the code does.

## Guidelines:

- Where choices are possible, pick the option that improves user experience and aesthetics rather than the fastest hack.
- Always provide sensible defaults and avoid requiring unnecessary configuration.
- If context is unclear, make a smart assumption and state it, rather than leaving code incomplete.
- Be concise: remove redundant code or explanations, but never sacrifice clarity.
